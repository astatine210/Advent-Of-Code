# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

Self-imposed rules:

* Solutions are in Python 3.10+
* Avoid brute force where possible.
* Try to keep the algorithms stripped-down and Pythonic.
* Readability counts. Comment generiously and run through `black`.
* Solutions have to be acceptable to Pylint (at least, my preferences for it).
